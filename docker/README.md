# Docker Enhancing Tools

* [Docker Socket Proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy) is a security-enhanced proxy for the Docker Socket. Containers requiring the docker socket be mounted instead access the docker socket through this container.   

* [Docker Cleanup](https://github.com/clockworksoul/docker-gc-cron) is a container that will periodically run the very excellent Spotify docker-gc script script to automatically clean up unused containers and images.
